##Chapter 9 - Support Vector Machines

####Question 4 
1. A clever approach to adding all diagonal (or off-diagonal) elements of a matrix. 

####Question 6 
1. Demonstration of how the value of cost affects the fit for an SVC.

####Question 7
1. All predictor parameters that are of the type factor must explicitly be set so before attempting an SVM fit. 
2. Desirable to scale predictor parameters especially when the data is from the "real" world and includes predictors measured dramatically different scales.
3. Avoid using predictor variables that are not likely to impact the fit, for e.g. names of cars.
